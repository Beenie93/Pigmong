# Pigmong
pigmong

Pigmong is an iot piggy bank made of Raspberry Pi 3, Adafruit Pro Trinket and Google AIY voice kit! + (servo motor, neopixel ring)

the reason why i used Google AIY voice kit was because i had it, you can use other stuff instead of the kit! and the other parts of the project as well!! (i just used a aiy board, a button and basic cloudspeech code!)

the main code are written with python in Ubuntu Linux and the code for hardware is written in Arduino IDE.

i refered to the left side codes for the project!

aiy_audio.py  ->  pigmong_audio.py   # it's just the same code as the former one! i wanted to classify code files that i used!

aiy_board.py  ->  pigmong_board.py   # i deleted some parts that i don't use!

aiy_cloudspeech.py  ->  pigmong_cloudspeech.py   # i added few lines for the neopixel ring and servo motor

cloudspeech_pre_demo.py  ->  pigmong246.py   # this is the main code!!!

As with the project, it would be great to hear your thoughts, questions, suggestions.
