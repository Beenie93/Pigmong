Pigmong

Pigmong is an iot piggy bank made of Raspberry Pi 3, Adafruit Pro Trinket and Google AIY voice kit! + (servo motor, neopixel ring)

the reason why i used Google AIY voice kit was because i had it, you can use other stuff instead of the kit! and the other parts of the project as well!! (i just used a aiy board, a button and basic cloudspeech code!)

but to use google api like cloudspeech or dialogflow, you need to sign up for google cloud platform.

the main code are written with python in Ubuntu Linux and the code for hardware is written in Arduino IDE.

i refered to some code for the project!

aiy_audio.py  ->  pigmong_audio.py   # it's just the same code as the former one! i wanted to classify code files that i used!
aiy_board.py  ->  pigmong_board.py   # i deleted some parts that i don't use!
aiy_cloudspeech.py  ->  pigmong_cloudspeech.py   # i added few lines for the neopixel ring and servo motor
cloudspeech_pre_demo.py  ->  pigmong246.py   # this is the main code!!!

As with the project, it would be great to hear your thoughts, questions, suggestions.
