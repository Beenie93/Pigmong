pigmong

Pigmong is an iot piggy bank made of Raspberry Pi 3, Adafruit Pro Trinket and Google AIY voice kit!

(the reason why i used Google AIY voice kit was because i had it, you can use other stuff instead of the kit! and the other parts of the project as well!)

the main code are written with python in Ubuntu Linu and the code for hardware is written in Arduino IDE.
